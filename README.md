# Predicting-NBA-Games

The goal of this project was to predict the outcome of NBA games in order to use for betting. The US is moving towards legalizing sports betting so the goal is to make a model a gambler can use to know which team to bet on. The data contains historical moneyline odds on NBA games for the past 10 seasons from three different online bookmakers, the game's result, and each team's various ratings.
